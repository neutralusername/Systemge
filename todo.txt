build specialized "dashboards" for various packages. for example to add topics to broker server/resolver through a web mask, manage clients on sytemge server, etc
-allow the systemgeServerDashboard and systemgeClientDashboard the ability to manage all its connections like through the systemgeConnectionDashboard
-systemgeConnectionDashboard X
-systemgeServerDashboard 
-brokerResolverDashboard
-brokerClientDashboard  (include visual elements that represent subscribed topics and whether they are successfully connected to)
-brokerServerDashboard
-singleRequestServerDashboard
-websocketServerDashboard
-httpServerDashboard
-oauth2ServerDashboard

implement manual metrics update in some form (especially in regards to ranges of average values (e.g. bytes sent not together with messages sent))
create more/smaller metric types for systemge-structs
implement different types of data visualizations
create some sort of menu to view selected metric-types

implement "password" in some form into the dashboard (for the beginning as access control as an alternative to whitelist)

improve logging (especially systemge and broker packages)

make websocketServer stop-operation cleaner

add "syncResponsesSent" metrics to connection

update oauth2server (add dashboard client etc.)

update readme

re-create "nodes" consisting of messageBrokerClient, httpServer, websocketServer and dashboardClient

add ChannelConnection and channelListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single process
consider adding PipeConnection and PipeListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single device

allow some kind of grouping of metrics on dashboards (no concrete ideas yet, probably further in the future)

write something that takes in configs and create an executable, that can be used to easily perform systemge-operations through the (os-)command line (such as sending messages) i.e. through the provided args

possibly create a way to access systemge-operations (i.e. operations from a structs like systemgeServer) through os-level shared memory and synchronization (syscall package)

support the option for custom dashboard clients and frontend pages (react components)
