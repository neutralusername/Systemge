find exact reason for the ram spikes (something todo w restarting) - DONE - reason was, i never closed the connection when the client stopped...

there is some other or related issue that causes ram spikes more rarely - issue can be replicated by repeated brokerServer restarts (previously by brokerClient restarts and more frequently)
