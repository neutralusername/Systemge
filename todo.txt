re-create "nodes" consisting of messageBrokerClient, httpServer, websocketServer and dashboardClient

integrate "password" in some form into the dashboard#

add access control commands to broker structs

add command scheduling in some form (to the dashboard)

add ChannelConnection and channelListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single process
consider adding PipeConnection and PipeListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single device

add some functionality that supports running systemge-apps in the background while allowing to execute commands through the terminal (no concrete plan yet) (i think this can actually be done already with the golang flag package)
