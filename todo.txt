fix rare race condition on systemgeServer (waitGroup)

improve logging (especially systemge and broker packages)

make websocketServer stop-operation cleaner

add "syncResponsesSent" metrics to connection

update oauth2server (add dashboard client etc.)

update readme

re-create "nodes" consisting of messageBrokerClient, httpServer, websocketServer and dashboardClient

integrate "password" in some form into the dashboard

add ChannelConnection and channelListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single process
consider adding PipeConnection and PipeListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single device

allow some kind of grouping of metrics on dashboards (no concrete ideas yet, probably further in the future)
