build specialized "dashboards" for various packages. for example to add topics to broker server/resolver through a web mask, manage clients on sytemge server, etc
-allow the systemgeServerDashboard and systemgeClientDashboard the ability to manage all its connections like through the systemgeConnectionDashboard
-systemgeConnectionDashboard X
-systemgeServerDashboard X
-brokerResolverDashboard
-brokerClientDashboard  (include visual elements that represent subscribed topics and whether they are successfully connected to)
-brokerServerDashboard
-singleRequestServerDashboard
-websocketServerDashboard
-httpServerDashboard
-oauth2ServerDashboard

single request server - will work based on systemge.Connection and IMessage i think (similar to existing functionality)
(same for broker-system)

make dashboard less repetitive (implementation-/code wise) ..

"systemge client" - a mechanism that receives a list of listeners that it will attempt to connect to and maintain that connection through reconnect attempts
    +(group of clients connected to various listeners that can be messaged conveniently)
    +(insights whether all listeners are connected to currently (was handled through the services status (started/pending)))

add sample how systemge can be used as a proxy

consider/support config changes at runtime.
right now this is not officially supported and works for some fields, but not for others.

add sync messaging system between websocketServer and its clients

add authentication/key mechanism for listeners

display error responses somehow on dashboard
hide password input on dashboard (will create a custom password-mask and remove the usage of prompt-popup)
add status for non-landing pages
more expressive response messages (so it becomes clear what the underlying request/command was)
make content less ugly (style for input elements, status, metrics)

create some sort of menu to view selected metrics-types

add http calls for dashboard commands somehow

add dashboard chat/notes

implement different types of data visualizations
implement manual metrics update in some form (especially in regards to ranges of average values (e.g. bytes sent not together with messages sent))

option to create csv file based on update routine and response messages
maybe other types of csv files as well (e.g. connects/disconnects, message timestamps, topics and senders?)

refactor brokerResolver to use singleRequestServer

update readme

re-create "nodes" consisting of messageBrokerClient, httpServer, websocketServer and dashboardClient

add ChannelConnection and channelListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single process
consider adding PipeConnection and PipeListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single device

write something that takes in configs and creates an executable, that can be used to easily perform systemge-operations through the (os-)command line (such as sending messages) i.e. through the provided args

possibly create a way to access systemge-operations (i.e. operations from a structs like systemgeServer) through os-level shared memory and synchronization (syscall package)

support the option for custom dashboard clients and frontend pages (react components)

extend syncToken functionality so that you can register/manage syncTokens/responses more independetly of sync requests 
sync request/responses api will stay virtually unchanged (the connection.SyncResponse() method will change slightly to work based on token instead based on message)
in addition it will be possible to register syncTokens on receiver side, and gather manual sync responses (connection.SyncResponse())
with the effect, that one connection can send multiple responses for one sync token (while leaving everything else as easy to use as it is now)
Add SyncResponses struct that is returned instead of a message channel. the struct can be used to receive response messages or cancel the token. (also make it possible to get the response channel)
change syncRequests/tokens to either stay alive until a certain time passed, or a certain number of responses was received (or was manually cancelled)

add some functionality to visualize how clients of a dashboardServer are connected to each other (ask them for connected names)

give option to use custom marshallers (idk about implementation details yet)

offer some kind of support/guidance for implementing distributed transactions (aka multi part operations that can be reversed if one sub operation fails)
