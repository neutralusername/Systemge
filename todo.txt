find exact reason for the ram spikes (something todo w restarting) - DONE - reason was, i never closed the connection when the client stopped...

there is some other or related issue that causes ram spikes more rarely - I will ignore this issue for now since this also occurs on the other branch/ without any broker structs and for seemingly unrelated reasons. maybe something to do with go.
