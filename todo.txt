build specialized "dashboards" for various packages. for example to add topics to broker server/resolver through a web mask, manage clients on sytemge server, etc
-allow the systemgeServerDashboard and systemgeClientDashboard the ability to manage all its connections like through the systemgeConnectionDashboard
-systemgeConnectionDashboard X
-systemgeServerDashboard 
-brokerResolverDashboard
-brokerClientDashboard  (include visual elements that represent subscribed topics and whether they are successfully connected to)
-brokerServerDashboard
-singleRequestServerDashboard
-websocketServerDashboard
-httpServerDashboard
-oauth2ServerDashboard

add close button for dashboard server as well as all clients
create some sort of menu to view selected metrics-types
option to create csv file based on update routine
rework dashboard design (menu bar, iphone support etc)
implement different types of data visualizations
implement manual metrics update in some form (especially in regards to ranges of average values (e.g. bytes sent not together with messages sent))

maybe other types of csv files as well

make websocketServer stop-operation cleaner

update oauth2server (add dashboard client etc.)

update readme

improve logging (especially systemge and broker packages)

re-create "nodes" consisting of messageBrokerClient, httpServer, websocketServer and dashboardClient

add ChannelConnection and channelListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single process
consider adding PipeConnection and PipeListener as more performant alternative for systems within a single device

write something that takes in configs and create an executable, that can be used to easily perform systemge-operations through the (os-)command line (such as sending messages) i.e. through the provided args

possibly create a way to access systemge-operations (i.e. operations from a structs like systemgeServer) through os-level shared memory and synchronization (syscall package)

support the option for custom dashboard clients and frontend pages (react components)

extend syncToken functionality so that you can register/manage syncTokens/responses more independetly of sync requests 
sync request/responses api will stay virtually unchanged (the connection.SyncResponse() method will change slightly to work based on token instead based on message)
in addition it will be possible to register syncTokens on receiver side, and gather manual sync responses (connection.SyncResponse())
with the effect, that one connection can send multiple responses for one sync token (while leaving everything else as easy to use as it is now)
Add SyncResponses struct that is returned instead of a message channel. the struct can be used to receive response messages or cancel the token. (also make it possible to get the response channel)
change syncRequests/tokens to either stay alive until a certain time passed, or a certain number of responses was received (or was manually cancelled)
